Apalis Dashboard is a UI built on top of [Apalis](https://github.com/geofmureithi/apalis) to help you visualize your queues and their jobs.
With this library you get a beautiful UI for visualizing what's happening with each job in your queues, their status and some actions that will enable you to get the job done.

## Developing

If you want to help us to solve the issues, be it a bug, a feature or a question, you might need to fork and clone this project.

To fork a project means you're going to have your own version of it under your own GitHub profile, you do it by clicking the "Fork" button on the top of any project's page on GitHub.

Cloning a project means downloading it to your local machine, you do it in the command line:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/apalis-board.git
```

That will create a `bull-board` folder inside the directory you executed the command, so you need to navigate inside it:

```sh
cd apalis-board
```

_This project requires that you have [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) installed_

Also make sure you are running Redis for this project (bull-board's example connects to Redis' default port `6379`).

Now, to try it out locally you can run:

```sh
yarn && yarn start:dev --env API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```
