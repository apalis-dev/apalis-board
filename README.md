## Starting

To add it to your project start by adding the library to your dependencies list:

```sh
yarn add bull-board
```

Or

```sh
npm i bull-board
```

## Hello World

### Add existing Bull Queue(s)

When you already defined your queue(s) you can add them using the `setQueues` function.

```js
const Queue = require('bull');

const someQueue = new Queue();
const someOtherQueue = new Queue();

const { setQueues } = require('bull-board')

setQueues(someQueue)

// OR

setQueues([
    someQueue,
    someOtherQueue
])
```

You can then add `UI` to your middlewares (this can be set up using an admin endpoint with some authentication method):

```js
const app = require('express')()
const { UI } = require('bull-board')

app.use('/admin/queues', UI)

// other configurations for your server
```

## Developing

To try it out locally you can clone this repo and run:

```sh
yarn && yarn start:example
```

Just make sure you spin up a Redis instance locally (default port is 6379).

## Further ref

For further ref, please check [Bull's docs](https://optimalbits.github.io/bull/). Apart from the way you configure and start your UI, this library doesn't hijack Bull's way of working.

> Bull-board is also compatible with BullMQ (aka Bull4). You can learn more on [BullMQ's docs](https://docs.bullmq.io/).
